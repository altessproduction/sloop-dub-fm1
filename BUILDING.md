# Building SLOOP Dub

The build makes three files in `build/`:

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `felucca.bin` | the firmware app |
| `loader/ota.bin` | the update loader |
| `felucca.fwsc` | the installable package (app + loader) |

## Prerequisites (macOS)

- Python 3 with Pillow: `pip3 install Pillow`
- Docker Desktop. The JieLi toolchain is Linux x86-64 only; the build runs each tool in a
  `linux/amd64` `debian:bookworm-slim` container (Rosetta on Apple silicon). Keep the source
  tree in a folder Docker can share, e.g. under `/Users`.
- The JieLi Linux toolchain (clang 4.0.1 for pi32v2, from JieLi's package server):

  ```
  tools/get_toolchain.sh            # installs to ~/.jieli/toolchain
  ```

- The JieLi AC79 SDK (Apache-2.0). The package uses three of its files
  (`cpu/wl82/tools/uboot.boot`, `cfg_tool.bin`, `cfg/eq_cfg_hw.bin`); they are not part of this tree.

  ```
  git clone --depth 1 --branch AC79NN_SDK_V1.2.1_2023-12-13 \
      https://gitee.com/Jieli-Tech/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK.git ~/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK
  ```

- Node.js (optional, for the web tests).

On Linux x86-64 the toolchain runs natively and Docker is not needed.

## Build

```
./build.sh
```

`JIELI_TOOLCHAIN` and `AC79_SDK` override the default locations
(`~/.jieli/toolchain`, `~/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK`).

`./build.sh --release 0.9-beta` makes a release build: the package identity becomes
`FM-1_909` and the version string `0.9-BETA`; the package is `build/felucca-0.9-beta.fwsc`.

Build options (environment, `0` or `1`; defaults in `firmware/src/felucca.c`):

| Flag | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FELUCCA_FLASH` | 1 | settings, presets and projects in flash |
| `FELUCCA_OTA` | 1 | update entry (needs `FELUCCA_FLASH`) |
| `FELUCCA_CDC` | 1 | USB serial console |
| `FELUCCA_UAC` | 1 | USB audio input: the master output, 44.1 kHz stereo (after Felucca 1.0) |
| `FELUCCA_UART` | 1 | TRS MIDI IN (the 3.5 mm jack) |

## Samples

The CC0 instrument samples that the SAMPLE engine uses are in `assets/samples-cc0/`
(Versilian Studios, see `ATTRIBUTION.txt` there). `tools/fetch_cc0.py` downloads them
again from the source repositories. Without that folder the build still works and the
SAMPLE engine has only the generated drum kit.

## The browser emulator

The playable web emulator (the real firmware compiled to WebAssembly) is rebuilt with:

```sh
sh reference_emu/build.sh          # clang + lld wasm32, no emscripten
node reference_emu/wasm_smoke_test.js docs/dub/sloop.wasm
```

It refreshes `docs/dub/` (the GitHub Pages copy) with the new binary and page.
The smoke test is the shipped check: exports, the dub audio path, the band mutes,
the riddim bank and a real transport play.

## Install

The `.fwsc` of each release is on the GitHub releases page and in `docs/firmware/`.

From the command line (needs `pip3 install mido python-rtmidi`):

```
python3 tools/fm1_install.py build/felucca.fwsc
python3 tools/fm1_install.py --info          # identity of the connected FM-1
```

Installing firmware is at your own risk. If an install fails and the FM-1 no longer
starts, recovery needs [FM-1-transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter).
